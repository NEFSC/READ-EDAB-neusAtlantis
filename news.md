# neus-atlantis 1.0.0-9008 (in dev) 

#### Post-processing Routine split across 3 functions

* get_atl_paramfiles.R: Generates paths for parameter file names
* process_atl_output.R: Creates "result" object similar to the one generated by atlantistools package (modified from RM_preprocess_v2.R)
* make_atlantis_diagnostic_figures.R: Gerenates figures (modified from RM_atl_model_calibration.R)
* test post-processing.R: example call of post-processing functions

#### New file names for R scripts
* Under format Action_Subject_Modifier (i.e. plot_ROMS_summary.R)
organized under common "action" terms

    > make_* = creates non-figure files
    >
    > plot_* = creates figures
    >
    > fix_* = modifies files to correct/adjust values
    >
    > flatten_* = Converts netCDF files into flat files/lists
    >
    > call_* = Scripts that call on existing functions
 
#### Slight modifications to ROMS processing script (make_ROMS_files_2.R)
* Generalized to allow for multi-day input files. Should work for arbitrary length but only tested for annual files.
* Changed call on above script for new COBALT files

As described in [#40](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/neus-atlantis/pull/40)


# neus-atlantis 1.0.0-9007 (in dev) 

* Mackerel and Menhaden Update
* Increased Mackerel recruits
    + Mackerel persists to end now, though at perhaps too high a biomass - will need to be tuned further after next forcing files
* Increased Menhaden recruits, assimilation efficiency and modified age structure of the catch to allow larger age classes to persist better
* Increased growth on Menhaden's first 3 age classes
* Menhaden persists to end now and at about half of Mackerel's biomass

As described in [#37](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/neus-atlantis/pull/37) & 
[#39](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/neus-atlantis/pull/39)

# neus-atlantis 1.0.0-9006 (in dev) 
(built with altantis rev 6490)

#### Major fixes

* Fixes incorrect conversion from COBALT (mol X/ kg H20) to Atlantis (mg X/m3) units
* Updated LTL-Forcing scripts
* Removed initial conditions scaling of forced LTL groups

As described in [#30]( https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/neus-atlantis/pull/30)

#### Minor fixes

Adds forcing files for NH3, NO3, O2, and Si. Includes:
* New scripts
* Pulling and aggregating data from ROMS_COBALT
* Converting data into Atlantis forcing files
* Plotting variables from nutrient forcing
* Added new nutrient forcing files
* Updated force_WIN_test.prm with nutrient forcing

As described in [#33](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/neus-atlantis/pull/33)


# neus-atlantis 1.0.0-9005 (in dev) 
(built with altantis rev 6490)

Tested the run with the COBALT forcing for lower trophic levels
* Herring persisted at full fishing levels - but still drop after the 50th time step, not to as great a magnitude as previously
Increased herring recruit numbers
* Mackerel persist and probably need to have biological parameters reduced a bit to constrain growth

As described in [#31]( https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/neus-atlantis/pull/31)

# neus-atlantis 1.0.0-9004 (in dev) 
(built with altantis rev 6490)

* Fixed a recruitment issue with Herring related to a bug in the code if it happens too late in the year

+ This is a fudge, and needs to be reverted once the bug is fixed in Atlantis

* Fixed the lower trophic levels that herring and mackerel rely on, to persist at levels at which starvation isn't an issue

    + Increased the initial biomasses of phytoplankton and zooplankton groups
    + Tweaked the pprey values between the lower trophic levels to keep species from being preyed upon enough to crash
    
* Increased initial biomass values for Mackerel and Herring
* Increased recruits per year for Mackerel and Herring
* Increased assimilation efficiency for Mackerel and Herring

    + Mackerel persists at resonable levels
    + Herring still collapses at time step 51 with normal fishing
    
* Changed the age structure of the catch for Mackerel and Herring to prevent overfishing at lower age classes
* Affects: at_biology_test.prm, at_run_test.prm, at_harvest_test.prm
 
As described in ([#28](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/neus-atlantis/pull/28))

# neus-atlantis 1.0.0-9003 (in dev) 
(built with altantis rev 6490)

Incorporates new LTL forcing, associated parameter file changes, and additional R scripts to process and interpret forcing data ([#26](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/neus-atlantis/pull/26))


# neus-atlantis 1.0.0-9002 (in dev)
(built with altantis rev 6490)

Dynamic and forced models diverge at this point. ROMS_COBALT-Forcing ([#25](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/neus-atlantis/pull/25))

# neus-atlantis 1.0.0-9001 (in dev)
(built with altantis rev 6490)

* Reduces magnitude of Diatom (PL) bloom and stabilizes closer to initial biomass
    + Reduce mum_PL
    + Increase predation on PL by Meiobenthos (BO) in sediment (reduces sediment accumulation)
    + Decrease cannibalism of BO
* Slight increase in longevity of scallops (SCA) and Lobseter (LOB)
    + Decreased cannibalism in LOB (and other benthic carnivores)
    + Increase grazing of benthic filter feeders (CLA, SCA, QHG, BFF) on PL and decrease consumption of refractory detritus (DR)
* As described [commit](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/neus-atlantis/commit/b9ae18adc29c1f55b94da4b61eb9fb0ebadaae04)

Changes to: at_biology.prm
