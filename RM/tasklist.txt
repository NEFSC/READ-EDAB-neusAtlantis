Atlantis Task List

Biology
Growth
Keep all species to within 20% of initial condition values for RN
SB, REP, BWH, RWH, PIN causing issues still
Stability for long runs not optimal yet, RN drops after 10, 25 yrs
Constrain total biomass to 20% initial conditions values (fishing will impact this heavily)
GOO, HER 10 yr increase biomass then ‘crash’ to stable level - recruitment issues? Nums at age plots look strange
-> Dynamic tuning - recalibration required after each run as values are changed for mum, C, and kdenr; high sensitivity for LTL on RN of higher trophics

Diet
Ensure meaningful diet contributions for major predators: 
Issues: 
currently squid-heavy diets for many, including apex preds
ANC, HER not represented well as primary diet item for predators (but often in ‘rest’)
HAL adult primary pred not sharks but HAD
SHK & WHK primary predators for many large fish (some OK)
-> Adjust pPrey as required (in process); ensure overlap in space/time of expected matchups (see next item)
-> adjusted vertday_XXX vertnight_XXX to see if matchups in space/time different

	Migration
Ensure migrations are accurate depictions, not just copy of parent/daughter (TUN, BFT, TWH, STH, BWH, RWH)
Balance nutrients/phytoplankton growth in GOM boxes - add eddy effects on growth?
-> verify spatial patterns; need data (or general guide) for sharks and other vertebrates not captured in trawl survey


Catch
Create global biomass removal catch time series file from Sean L’s data
Test global biomass removal catch time series file with best version of Biology (and other) parameter files
Sanity check results for sanity checks:
Modeled removals match expecteds
Biomass affected by removals
Removals from Age classes looks appropriate
Need to get data for age/size structure of removals
Within 20% 
    -	Iterate with Biology tasks until Biology reaches goals above
    -	Apportion catch to boxes
    -	Do sanity checks as above
    -	Iterate with Biology tasks until Biology reaches goals above
