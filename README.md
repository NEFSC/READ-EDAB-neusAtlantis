Atlantis is a series of submodels (biological, geophysical, fishing,
assessment, and management) and as a whole simulates a Management
Strategy Evaluation (MSE) procedure which allows for qualitative
comparisons of different management choices. We have parameterized
Atlantis for the Northeast United States Continental Shelf (NEUS),
including the major functional groups from an ecosystem perspective. We
have also parameterized and simulated the physiographic dynamics of the
ecosystem, as well as the most important fleets. Our goal was to
recreate, at least in approximate terms, the biomass, catch, and effort
trends in the NEUS from 1964 to the mid
2000s.
