## Primary Production and Benthic Community Update

* JC: 02-13-2020
* Reduces magnitude of Diatom (PL) bloom and stabilizes closer to initial biomass
    + Reduce mum_PL
    + Increase predation on PL by Meiobenthos (BO) in sediment (reduces sediment accumulation)
    + Decrease cannibalism of BO
* Slight increase in longevity of scallops (SCA) and Lobseter (LOB)
    + Decreased cannibalism in LOB (and other benthic carnivores)
    + Increase grazing of benthic filter feeders (CLA, SCA, QHG, BFF) on PL and decrease consumption of refractory detritus (DR)
* Affects: at_biology.prm
